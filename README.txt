This program is running on Python version 3.6.4 (could not use 3.5).

The program consists of two files, client.py and server.py. To run the programs, you can open a command line interface and run 
from the working directory of the client.

The following are the formats used- 

client.py- python (or py for Windows systems) client.py [ip address of server] [port number or server]
server.py- python (or py for Windows Systems) server.py [port number]

Alternatively, you can also use the command line and from the directory in which your Python installation is located, run-
 
>>> python [filename].py client.py [ip address of server] [port number or server]
>>> python [filename].py server.py [port number]

All necessary files were saved in their directories. It is recommended to use two
separate directories for the server and client files. You can simply add files to call wherever they are
needed.

When prompted, use the command line to input the arguments. 

Your options are the following-
get [file_name]
put [file_name]
rename [old_file_name] [new_file_name]
list
exit
